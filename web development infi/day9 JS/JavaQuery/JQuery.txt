JQuery is a JS library which works as "write less and do more".
The purpose of JQuery is to make it much easier to use JS on webpage.
JQuery also simplifies lot of complicated things from JS like ajax calls and DOM manipulation.
Syntax: $(document).ready(function(){
	//JQuery method goes here
	});
JQuery method should always be written in a script tag in the header section.
$ sign defines JQuery.
$(document).ready helps to load a complete webpage successfully.
